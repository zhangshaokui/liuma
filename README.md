## Preview

Get a feel for the UX — here's a quick look at what's possible.

### 🧩 Browser Automation with Playwright MCP

![preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4febb04-26d5-45da-a7bb-f7d452d333c2)

**Example:** Control a web browser using Microsoft's [playwright-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) tool.

- The LLM autonomously decides how to use tools from the MCP server, calling them multiple times to complete a multi-step task and return a final message.

Sample prompt:

```prompt
1. Use the @tool('web-search') to look up information about “modelcontetprotocol.”

2. Then, using : @mcp("playwright")
   - navigate Google (https://www.google.com)
   - Click the “Login” button
   - Enter my email address (neo.cgoing@gmail.com)
   - Clock the "Next"  button
   - Close the browser
```

<br/>

### 🔗 Visual Workflows as Custom Tools

<img width="1912" height="953" alt="workflow" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e69e72e8-595c-480e-b519-4531f4c6331f" />

<img width="1567" alt="workflow-mention" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf3e1339-ee44-4615-a71d-f6b46833e41f" />

**Example:** Create custom workflows that become callable tools in your chat conversations.

- Build visual workflows by connecting LLM nodes (for AI reasoning) and Tool nodes (for MCP tool execution)
- Publish workflows to make them available as `@workflow_name` tools in chat
- Chain complex multi-step processes into reusable, automated sequences

<br/>

### 🤖 Custom Agents

<img width="1567" alt="agent-example" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0a325c0-ff1e-4038-b6bf-fcf57659a5c1" />

**Example:** Create specialized AI agents with custom instructions and tool access.

- Define custom agents with specific system prompts and available tools
- Easily invoke agents in chat using `@agent_name`
- Build task-specific assistants like a GitHub Manager agent with issue/PR tools and project context

For instance, create a GitHub Manager agent by:

- Providing GitHub tools (issue/PR creation, comments, queries)
- Adding project details to the system prompt
- Calling it with `@github_manager` to manage your repository

<br/>

### 🎙️ Realtime Voice Assistant + MCP Tools

<p align="center">
  <video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2657b8c-ce0b-40dd-80b6-755324024973" width="100%" />
</p>

This demo showcases a **realtime voice-based chatbot assistant** built with OpenAI's new Realtime API — now extended with full **MCP tool integration**.
Talk to the assistant naturally, and watch it execute tools in real time.

### ⚡️ Quick Tool Mentions (`@`) & Presets

<img width="1225" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfe76b3b-c3d8-436e-8a7c-7b23292e234c" loading="lazy"/>

Quickly call tool during chat by typing `@toolname`.
No need to memorize — just type `@` and pick from the list!

**Tool Selection vs. Mentions (`@`) — When to Use What:**

- **Tool Selection**: Make frequently used tools always available to the LLM across all chats. Great for convenience and maintaining consistent context over time.
- **Mentions (`@`)**: Temporarily bind only the mentioned tools for that specific response. Since only the mentioned tools are sent to the LLM, this saves tokens and can improve speed and accuracy.

Each method has its own strengths — use them together to balance efficiency and performance.

You can also create **tool presets** by selecting only the MCP servers or tools you need.
Switch between presets instantly with a click — perfect for organizing tools by task or workflow.

### 🧭 Tool Choice Mode

<img width="1225" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fc64c6a-30c9-41a4-a5e5-4e8804f73473" loading="lazy"/>

Control how tools are used in each chat with **Tool Choice Mode** — switch anytime with `⌘P`.

- **Auto:** The model automatically calls tools when needed.
- **Manual:** The model will ask for your permission before calling a tool.
- **None:** Tool usage is disabled completely.

This lets you flexibly choose between autonomous, guided, or tool-free interaction depending on the situation.

### 🛠️ Default Tools

#### 🌐 Web Search

<img width="1034" height="940" alt="web-search" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/261037d9-e1a7-44ad-b45e-43780390a94e" />

Built-in web search powered by [Exa AI](https://exa.ai). Search the web with semantic AI and extract content from URLs directly in your chats.

- **Optional:** Add `EXA_API_KEY` to `.env` to enable web search
- **Free Tier:** 1,000 requests/month at no cost, no credit card required
- **Easy Setup:** Get your API key instantly at [dashboard.exa.ai](https://dashboard.exa.ai)

#### 🎨 Image Generation

<img width="1034" height="940" loading="lazy" alt="image-generation" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b081c837-8948-4f4d-a2f4-c8630cf0eaa2" />

Built-in image generation and editing capabilities powered by AI models. Create, edit, and modify images directly in your chats.

- **Supported Operations:** Image generation, editing, and composition
- **Current Models:** Gemini Nano Banana, OpenAI

#### ⚡️ JS,PYTHON Executor

<img width="1225" alt="js-executor-preview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7deed824-e70b-46d4-a294-de20ed4dc869" loading="lazy"/>

It is a simple JS execution tool.

#### 📊 Data Visualization Tools

**Interactive Tables**: Create feature-rich data tables with advanced functionality:

- **Sorting & Filtering**: Sort by any column, filter data in real-time
- **Search & Highlighting**: Global search with automatic text highlighting
- **Export Options**: Export to CSV or Excel format with lazy-loaded libraries
- **Column Management**: Show/hide columns with visibility controls
- **Pagination**: Handle large datasets with built-in pagination
- **Data Type Support**: Proper formatting for strings, numbers, dates, and booleans

**Chart Generation**: Visualize data with various chart types (bar, line, pie charts)

> Additionally, many other tools are provided, such as an HTTP client for API requests and more.

## Getting Started

> This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the recommended package manager.

```bash
# If you don't have pnpm:
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Quick Start (Docker Compose Version) 🐳

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm i

# 2. Enter only the LLM PROVIDER API key(s) you want to use in the .env file at the project root.
# Example: The app works with just OPENAI_API_KEY filled in.
# (The .env file is automatically created when you run pnpm i.)

# 3. Build and start all services (including PostgreSQL) with Docker Compose
pnpm docker-compose:up

```

### Quick Start (Local Version) 🚀

```bash
pnpm i

#(Optional) Start a local PostgreSQL instance
# If you already have your own PostgreSQL running, you can skip this step.
# In that case, make sure to update the PostgreSQL URL in your .env file.
pnpm docker:pg

# Enter required information in the .env file
# The .env file is created automatically. Just fill in the required values.
# For the fastest setup, provide at least one LLM provider's API key (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY, CLAUDE_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, etc.) and the PostgreSQL URL you want to use.

pnpm build:local && pnpm start

# (Recommended for most cases. Ensures correct cookie settings.)
# For development mode with hot-reloading and debugging, you can use:
# pnpm dev
```

Alternative: Use Docker Compose for DB only (run app via pnpm)

```bash
# Start Postgres only via compose
# Ensure your .env includes: POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_DB matching POSTGRES_URL
docker compose -f docker/compose.yml up -d postgres

# Apply migrations
pnpm db:migrate


# Run app locally
pnpm dev   # or: pnpm build && pnpm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to get started.
